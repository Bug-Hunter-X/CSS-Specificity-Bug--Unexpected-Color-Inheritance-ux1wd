To consistently ensure the `color: blue` rule takes precedence, you can use the `!important` flag or increase the specificity of the selector.  However, overusing `!important` should be avoided.  Here's how to solve it with improved selector specificity:

```css
div.container p {
  color: blue !important; 
}

div p {
  color: red;
}
```

OR a more robust solution without `!important`:

```css
.container p {
  color: blue;
}

div p {
  color: red;
}
```

By making the selector for the blue color more specific (removing the 'div' from the first selector, but using a class instead of a div), it prevents conflicting specificity issues with the less specific selector.
